## Hello there

👩‍💻👨‍💻 We are the Dingolytics team.

🎄 2024-Dec-25: Christmas update: Endpoints feature and refreshed [self-hosted](https://github.com/Dingolytics/selfhosted) documentation

We build Dingolytics to help getting started with end-to-end data management from day one of project development cycle. We provide management layer for ClickHouse and Vector to make integration easier and quicker to set up.

Our tech stack includes:

- ClickHouse as a main data storage
- Vector as a data ingestion tool
- Dingolytics API and web UI applications

🚧 The project is under active development and things are going to change. Yes, this is a DISCLAIMER.
